hSlides is a jQuery horizontal accordion, sliding the panels around to reveal one of interest. It's very flexible on how to move the panels.

Configuration options:
- Width an height configuration, including width when the panel is closed, or when no panels are open (centered).
- Speed and easing of the animation.
- Event triggering the animation.
- Sensitivity threshold, interval and timeout to avoid unnecessary open/close.
- CSS class applied to the active pannel.
- Panel positioning:  first panel on the bottom and next on the top, or viceversa.
- Callback functions on enter and on leave.
